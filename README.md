## General info

Techjoy is a blog website I have been working on with 
Zayd Inani to fully understand Nodejs and to get our hands on the keyboard for a fun personal project and grow our team skills and get the chance to try to work together.

it obviously still missing some core features for a blog but we planning to come back soon to develop TechJoy and take it to a whole new level .
